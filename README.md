Project Title: Matrix graphical visualizer

. Description:
This application is developed using Python and PyQt6 on the Windows operating system.
It is designed to visualize and analyze matrices in various ways.
The app provides tools to colorize matrices, visualize 2D projections of column or row spaces, and offers a built-in text editor for writing and executing Python code to manipulate matrices.
Users can modify matrix values using a table interface and compare different colorized matrices.
Additionally, the application supports animations for both colorizing matrices and 2D graphical representations, which can be created and controlled via the text editor
